# Dinghy: Horizontally Scaling Raft Clusters

#### _Abstract_

The increasing use of distributed systems in recent years brings about the need for more robust and scalable methods in which to reach consensus in a system. With the introduction of Raft, distributed consensus has become more widely available in used in the design of clusters, in many different scenarios. Though, as these clusters begin to increase in node size, they become increasingly less efficient at coming to consensus. We investigate ways to increase network throughput, nad propose methods to more effectively handle a growing number of nodes in a cluster, analyzing their effectiveness in a practical and realistic scenario.
