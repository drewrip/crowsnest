\section{Scaling Raft With Dynamic Timeouts}

Like all other algorithms of its class, Raft has similar problems scaling. Though it has a distrinctly unique set of problems. It should be noted that we can consider Raft generally \textit{synchronous}. That is, all nodes must reach a \textit{univalent} state, before handling the replication of the next update to the log. Raft's use of a \textit{leader}, requires all changes to the network state be processed through a single node, thereby essentially creating a synchronous cluster where in which \textit{followers} have very little power to influence the cluster's state when there is a healthy \textit{leader}. So when we discuss scaling in terms of a leader based methods we have to examine different properities of the algorithm.

We will begin breaking down a method with which we can use to achieve better scalabilty of the Raft consensus algorithm.
