\section{Scaling Raft With Dynamic Timeouts}

Now we begin to look at some of the possible methods to scale the Raft consensus algorithm, each with varying degree of complexity and success.

\subsection{Non-Voting Servers}

One common way of increasing the capabilities of a large Raft cluster, is to change the voting status of additonal nodes.
Usually when we discuss creating larger clusters, we mean creating a cluster of servers, each with full voting priveleges.
But every one of these members all having full voting power, requires extra considerations in the cluster.
When you are a \textit{full} node, you must participate in log replication, as well as be consulted when changes need to be made to the replicated log.
So a common solution to this requirement for being a \textit{full} voting server, is making some of the members \textit{non-voting} servers.
This allows for the node to participate in the cluster, gaining the benefits of the log replication, but not bogging down the cluster by increasing the quorum size.
