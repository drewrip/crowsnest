\section{Base Performance}

Of course before we look into some potentially beneficial alterations we could make to Raft, we must examine the base algorithms ability to scale.

To demonstrate the increase in difficulty in reaching agreement when the number of nodes increase, we ran a test, as previously defined, where in which no nodes die. As we see in this test, as we increase the number of nodes in a cluster, even without any extra difficulties like delays or node failures, consensus becomes harder to achieve. After this observation we can start to investigate improving the rate at which the time it takes to reach distributed agreement.
