\section{Dinghy Performance}

Testing the algorithm using the previously defined test.


With smaller clusters, Dinghy does not make any signficant changes toward the time it takes a cluster to run the test.
Though as the number of servers participating in consensus increases, the time it takes for the cluster to run the test decreases.
