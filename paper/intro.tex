\section{Introduction}

The Raft consensus algorithm originated to simplify the preexisting Paxos algorithm, while solving the same core problem \cite{OngaroRaft} with the same efficiency. For years, Paxos had dominated distributed consensus. At its core it defined a way in which a system could come to agreement on a given state \cite{LamportPPT}. Though, Paxos can be incredibly hard to comprehend. Many papers have been published in an attempt to offer a clearer explanation as to how Paxos functions \cite{LamportSimple, MazieresPractical}, but it continues to be a difficult system to implement at a practical level.
