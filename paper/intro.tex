\section{Introduction}

The Raft consensus algorithm originated to simplify the 
preexisting Paxos algorithm, while at the same time, 
solving the same core problem \cite{OngaroRaft} with a 
similar efficiency. For years, Paxos had dominated 
distributed consensus. At its core it defined a way in 
which a system could come to agreement on a given state 
\cite{LamportPPT}. Though, Paxos can be incredibly hard 
to comprehend. Many papers have been published in an 
attempt to offer a clearer explanation as to how Paxos 
functions \cite{LamportSimple, MazieresPractical}, but it 
continues to be a difficult system to implement at a 
practical level.

Ultimately, these algorithms define a method for a system to agree on a state \cite{BrandFSM}. They work to build a fault tolerant approach to distributed systems, the \textit{replicated state machine} \cite{SchneiderFSM}. In this context, a group of machines replicate a single state across themselves to create a fault tolerant system, that can handle the failure of a given node.
